## **Pull**

Pull session went great. Right now temperatures are pretty cold so a proper warmup is mandatory. Started off by doing some dynamic stretches and a few high-rep sets with light dumbbells to get my body up to speed. I've been trying recently to build more explosiveness in my pulls while still trying to control the negative part of the movement. For this week's session I did the following exercises:

- 3x3 weighted chin-ups with 20kg.
- 3x8 lat pulldons with 67kg.
- 3x8 chest supported rows with 25kg.
- 3x8 rear delts
- 3x8 bicep curls with 15kg.
- 3x12 neck curls with 5kg.
- 3x12 sit-ups with 10kg.

Recently I've tried to reduce the time I rest between sets to a minimum as I don't want to waste too much time. I expected to feel more tired but it seems like it doesn't have much impact. There isn't a drop in strength or any cramps which makes me think that I've been spending way too much time talking and looking around before.

## **Legs**

Leg sessions have been steadily improving as well. I've been trying to focus a lot on my technique especially for the squat. I recently found out that I've been bracing my core the wrong way for a long time so I basically started learning how to squat from scratch. Other exercises feel pretty since I've been training consistently for less than 2 months now. Steady progress on all fronts. This week I did:

- 3 sets of 4/3/3 reps on squats with 90kg.
- 1x10 on squats with 70kg.
- 3x12 leg extensions with 57kg.
- 3x12 leg curls with 57kg.
- 3x12 calf raises with 30kg.
- 3x12 sit-ups with 10kg.
- 5 mins of stretching.

I've been focusing a lot on stretching especially after leg workouts. I think that it has many benefits aside from the better mobility long term. My legs feel a lot better the day after I work out and I don't experience the regular joint pain during the cold days. I try to hold each position for at least 30 seconds with medium intensity.

## **Push**

Push day has been my favorite part of the week since I started. I feel generally strong during push day, making progress on pretty much every exercise and I'm barely feeling sore after the workout. The last couple of weeks I've been trying spend a little more time warming up the supporting muscle groups. I've also tried to be as explosive as I can during the warm-up sets on the bench. This week I did:

- 3x5 bench press with 70kg.
- 3x8 incline dumbbell press with 22.5kg each.
- 3x8 on the flies machine with 52kg.
- 3x10 cable pulldowns with 57kg.
- 3x10 lateral raises with 5kg discs.
- 3x12 sit-ups with 10kg.

I've been meaning to try out some different exercises for my shoulders. Maybe military or viking press since I don't think I'm fully exhausting the muscle with the incline dumbbell presses. As far as the bench goes, I've been trying to steadily increase the reps I can do with 70kg as I'm lifting without a spotter. As soon as I feel comfortable doing 6 reps for a few sets I plan on moving up to 80kg and see how it goes.
